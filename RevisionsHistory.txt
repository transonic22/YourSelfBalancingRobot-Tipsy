2.2 Working with fuzzy tuned PID proven code
2.3 More fuzzy less pid untested
2.4 very little pid   not working yet
2.2 Works the Best
2.5 Will be 2.2 with bits of 2.4 and Owens Autonomous Idea being it will balance well but the final stopping of motors will incorporte a more strict/vertical balance mode allowing drift for a set amount of space but not leaning.
2.6 replaced failed 2.5 back to version 2.2 and just owens code
2.7 added more commands for speech ]
2.8 is working 2.7 refined code needs standup refinment and errors in app taken care of (conflict control)
